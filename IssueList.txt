Issues:

1. During autoplay, Auto discarded card showing on opponent's discarded card list. But not updating in database table.

2. After reconnect, reconnected user need to be refresh his card.

3. If a user pull a card and then after he got dissconnected, Autoplay not discarding that pulled card, instead its pulling new card and discarding the same.
